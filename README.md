# Business Card App

Simple business card app UI. This project is made as part of [Android Basics in Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) course by Google.

I updated this business card to [API 35](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15).

### Prerequisites

* Ability to create and run a project in Android Studio.
* Experience with composable functions, which includes `Text` and `Image` composables.

### What I learned

- [x] How to build simple layouts with `Row` and `Column` composables, and arrange them with `horizontalAlignment` and `verticalArrangement` parameters.
- [x] How to customize Compose elements with a Modifier object.
